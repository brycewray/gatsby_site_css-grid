For decades, Dallas/Fort Worth-area sports page readers had the pleasure of reading content from the late [Blackie Sherrod](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/obituaries/2016/04/28/legendary-news-sportswriter-blackie-sherrod-dies-at-96/#). Perhaps his best-remembered output, although certainly only a small sample of his work, came in the form of a Sunday column he called "Scattershooting." Each edition thereof was---rather than the usual format and dedicated to just one subject---a collection of one- or two-sentence (mostly) sports-related opinions, reportage, *bon mots*, and just general Blackie-isms. He'd always begin each by saying something like: "Scattershooting while wondering whatever happened to *[formerly prominent figure, often not even tangentially related to sports]* &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."

The last few weeks of my life have been somewhat tumultuous and, frankly, I just haven't had sufficient mental clarity, much less time, to sit down and come up with a properly focused article.[^StopNow] Still, I do have a number of things---not necessarily more [curmudgeonish stuff](/posts/2019/11/curmudgeonish-2019)---I'd like to offer.

[^StopNow]: The obvious rejoinder is reminiscent of "Can we be funny? / Why start now?" joke from the [first post-9/11 *Saturday Night Live*](https://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/snl-letterman-jon-stewart-911-late-show-daily-show-1201725596/). Point taken.

What follows, then, is loosely based on the "Scattershooting" approach, but a bit broader. For now, let's call it "Mixed nuts," not only because of its intentionally miscellaneous nature but also, well, because it's coming from me. ’Nuff said. If I have a warm, fuzzy feeling about how it ends up *and* you readers don't emit howls of protest (all *[infinitesimally small number]* of you, of course), there may be more of it down the line. That's why I'm putting a date to it. There's no promise or threat that it'll be a monthly thing but, if I do it again, that'll be how I keep track of it.

So, let's sample some mixed nuts for November, 2019&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

The open-office concept has been exposed for what it is---simply a way for businesses to cram more people into less, and therefore cheaper, space, and actually a [disincentive to productivity](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/327142)---but, because it *is* cheaper for businesses, it will persist. I don't envy the next ten to fifteen years' worth of kids coming out of college who will be forced into it.

Although I've had this site [running](/posts/2019/10/now-gatsby-geezer) on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) for a few weeks now, I still think a lot about [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io). It was just *fun* to use. Gatsby can be at times, too, but more in a "Can I solve this 10,000-piece puzzle?" way.[^GatsbyMDX] The other thing that has me still wondering about Eleventy is the massive amount of JavaScript that goes with a Gatsby-delivered page. While the site is really fast, there's still a perceptible amount of time such content requires to download, especially for mobile users on scuzzy connectivity. Nonetheless, Gatsby's [considerable image-processing powers](/posts/2019/10/picture-perfect), its impressive use of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), and its staggering array of [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins) are hard to overlook and are keeping me with it for now---especially since Eleventy apparently by design won't have an official assets pipeline.

[^GatsbyMDX]: It also doesn't help that a solution for the [defaultLayouts issue with MDX](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17808) is still TBD.
