# Repo for brycewray.com

This is the repository from which the [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) is built. Please note that this is just as an example; the **real** site is done in a combination of [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

In the future, this README file will contain details that are more specific to this repository. In the meantime, check “[Different modes for different code](https://brycewray.com/posts/2020/04/different-modes-different-codes).”
